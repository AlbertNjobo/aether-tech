## Mapping signal collapse

We instrument field sites with low-profile nodes that record signal decay in real time. The resulting maps reveal where infrastructure can bend without breaking.

### Research notes

- Signal drift captured over 72 hours
- Adaptive routing across intermittent nodes
- Secure fallbacks for complete outages

```ts
export const retryWindowMs = 48000;
```
