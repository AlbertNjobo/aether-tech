## Proofs that preserve autonomy

When systems operate in sensitive environments, full disclosure is not an option. We use zero-knowledge proofs to validate integrity while keeping mission data protected.

### Applied concept

- Proof circuits for firmware attestations
- Secure enclave coordination
- Failure signaling without telemetry leakage

```rust
fn attest_payload() -> Result<(), AttestationError> {
    Ok(())
}
```
