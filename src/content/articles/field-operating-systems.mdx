## Systems that survive the field

Frontier environments require assumptions that differ from the lab. Latency is unpredictable, power budgets are tight, and the physical environment always wins. We design operating layers that expect failure and degrade gracefully.

### Core focus areas

- Offline-first control loops
- Deterministic recovery paths
- Telemetry that survives long transport gaps

```bash
systemd-analyze critical-chain
```

The goal is simple: reliable operation when nothing else is reliable.
